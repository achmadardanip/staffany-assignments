# Code Improvements Summary

This document summarizes the improvements made to address the following issues:

## 1. Removed Duplicate isPublished and publishedAt Fields

**Problem**: Both `Shift` and `Week` entities had `isPublished` and `publishedAt` fields, which was overkill since shifts belong to weeks.

**Solution**:
- Removed `isPublished` and `publishedAt` columns from the `Shift` entity
- Updated `shiftUsecase.ts` to check only `week.isPublished` instead of both `shift.isPublished` and `week.isPublished`
- Updated `mapShiftResponse` to derive publish status from the week: `shift.week?.isPublished ?? false`
- Removed code that set `isPublished` and `publishedAt` on individual shifts during create/update operations

**Benefits**:
- Single source of truth for publish status (Week entity)
- Simplified data model
- No risk of inconsistency between shift and week publish states
- Easier to maintain and understand

## 2. Refactored Large Shift.tsx Component

**Problem**: The Shift page component was 594 lines long, making it hard to maintain and test.

**Solution**:
Created four new reusable components:
1. **WeekNavigator** (`frontend/src/components/shift/WeekNavigator.tsx`): Handles week navigation controls (prev/next buttons and calendar button)
2. **WeekActions** (`frontend/src/components/shift/WeekActions.tsx`): Displays publish status and action buttons (Add Shift, Publish)
3. **ShiftTable** (`frontend/src/components/shift/ShiftTable.tsx`): Renders the table structure with headers
4. **ShiftTableRow** (`frontend/src/components/shift/ShiftTableRow.tsx`): Renders individual shift rows with edit/delete actions

**Result**:
- Reduced `Shift.tsx` from 594 to 417 lines (30% reduction)
- Better separation of concerns
- Components are now reusable and easier to test
- Improved code readability and maintainability

## 3. Added Transaction Support for Atomic Updates

**Problem**: The `publishWeek` function updated the week and shifts separately, risking partial updates if one operation failed.

**Solution**:
- Imported `dbConnection` from the database module
- Wrapped the publish operations in a transaction using `connection.transaction()`
- All repository operations within `publishWeek` now use the transactional entity manager
- Removed the separate shift update operation since shifts now derive their publish status from the week

**Benefits**:
- Atomic operations - either all changes succeed or all fail
- No risk of partial updates leaving the system in an inconsistent state
- Better data integrity

## 4. Improved Date/Time Handling with date-fns

**Problem**: String manipulation for dates and times was error-prone and didn't handle edge cases well.

**Solution**:
Updated `backend/src/shared/functions/shiftTime.ts`:
- Replaced manual string splitting with `date-fns` `parse()` function
- Used `isValid()` instead of `Number.isNaN()` for validation
- Used `parse()` with format strings for better time parsing
- Leveraged date-fns functions for all date/time operations instead of manual calculations

**Benefits**:
- More robust date/time parsing and validation
- Better error handling for invalid inputs
- Consistent use of a well-tested library
- Foundation for future timezone support if needed
- Less error-prone than string manipulation

## Files Changed

### Backend
- `backend/src/database/default/entity/shift.ts`: Removed duplicate fields
- `backend/src/usecases/shiftUsecase.ts`: Updated to use week's publish status
- `backend/src/usecases/weekUsecase.ts`: Added transaction support
- `backend/src/shared/functions/shiftTime.ts`: Improved date-fns usage
- `backend/tsconfig.json`: Excluded test files from build

### Frontend
- `frontend/src/pages/Shift.tsx`: Refactored into smaller components (417 lines, down from 594)
- `frontend/src/components/shift/WeekNavigator.tsx`: New component
- `frontend/src/components/shift/WeekActions.tsx`: New component
- `frontend/src/components/shift/ShiftTable.tsx`: New component
- `frontend/src/components/shift/ShiftTableRow.tsx`: New component
- `frontend/src/layouts/Dashboard.tsx`: Removed unused imports
- `frontend/src/pages/ShiftForm.tsx`: Removed unused function

## Testing

Both backend and frontend build successfully:
- Backend: `npm run build` ✓
- Frontend: `CI=true npm run build` ✓

## Future Considerations

1. **Timezone Support**: With improved date-fns usage, adding timezone support would be straightforward using `date-fns-tz`
2. **Database Migration**: Create a migration to drop the `isPublished` and `publishedAt` columns from the `shift` table
3. **Unit Tests**: Add tests for the new components and updated business logic
4. **E2E Tests**: Verify the transaction behavior and component interactions
